# Linear Regression Project ( Quantile Regression)


Hey everyone! 
In this blog, we’ve explored **Quantile Regression** — its mathematical foundation, how it differs from **Multiple Linear Regression**, key **evaluation metrics**, **advantages**, **disadvantages**, and common **pitfalls/mistakes**.  
As a bonus, we’ve also discussed **Bayesian Quantile Regression** and how it introduces uncertainty into the model.

You can read the full blog here:  
[**Quantile Regression Analysis**](https://saisri27.github.io/qranalysis/projects/quantile-regression/)

This repository contains the code and visualizations used in the analysis.  
Feel free to explore, experiment, and learn!
